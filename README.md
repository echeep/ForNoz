There's no readme here, there's barely a software license here, and there isn't even any software! I just include it out of habit, just to feel something, anything at all. 

Honestly, you're looking in the wrong place. There's a perfectly good weird file right up there to download. 


If you really need another hint, I suggest not wearing headphones?
